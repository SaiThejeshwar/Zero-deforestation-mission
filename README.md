This repo holds the code for the challenge Zero deforestation mission in the Schneider Electric European Hackathon.

Challenge goal

The challenge consists in creating an image classification model, which from a given dataset, predicts what type of deforestation appears in the image with the objective of early detection of this type of actions in protected lands.

Tasks

Explore the data
Create an image classification predictive model
Train the model with the training images
Find the model that maximizes the F1-score (macro.)
Test the model to classify the testing images
Evaluate the F1-score of the model with the test images

Datasets

The following resources are provided to complete the challenge:

A training 'csv' files that relate the ID of the images to their features and classes.
A testing 'csv' files that relate the ID of the images to their features.
A zip file containing a few thousand training and testing images. This zip file has a weight of 309MB.
